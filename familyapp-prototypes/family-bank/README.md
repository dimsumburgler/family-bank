# Family Bank 💰

A practice banking app for teaching kids money concepts. Built as a parent dashboard to manage child accounts, track savings goals, and introduce financial literacy through hands-on experience.

## What It Does

- **Multi-child support** — Manage accounts for multiple kids from one dashboard
- **Balance tracking** — View current balances and transaction history
- **Savings goals** — Set targets and track progress visually
- **Interest simulation** — Teach compound interest with adjustable rates
- **Transaction logging** — Record deposits, withdrawals, and interest payments

## Tech Stack

- React 18
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React (icons)
- Vite (build tool)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Future Ideas

- [ ] Full transaction history view with filters
- [ ] Savings goals management (create, edit, delete)
- [ ] Child login view (simplified UI for kids)
- [ ] Chore tracking with automatic allowance
- [ ] Spending categories and insights
- [ ] Export data / statements

## Why This Exists

Most banking apps for kids are either too simple (just a balance) or too complex (real money, real stress). This is a middle ground — a practice environment where kids can learn concepts like saving, interest, and budgeting without real-world consequences.
